# Tech

Please use [this tutorial](https://riptutorial.com/processing/example/31227/using-processing-with-eclipse#example "Using Processing with Eclipse by RIP Tutorial") to set up Processing in a Java IDE like Eclipse. (CC BY-SA 3.0 License)

```
To use Processing in Eclipse, start by creating a new Java project. Then, select File > Import and then choose General > File System to locate the core.jar file. It can be found in PATH_TO_PROCESSING/core/library/ for Windows or /Applications/Processing 3.app/Contents/Java/core/library/ for Mac. Once this is completed, right-click on core.jar and add it to the build path.
